**CML's BARN**

BARN â€“ Benefactor for Agriculture Resources & Need
A full-stack agri-tech platform built at Code for Good 2025 (Team 27) for the Centre for Microfinance & Livelihoods

ðŸ“¦ About the Project
BARN digitizes field operations for marginal farmers in Assam and Tripura. It replaces paper-based processes with a cloud solution that lets administrators, managers, and farmers:

Capture crop & livestock data in real time.
